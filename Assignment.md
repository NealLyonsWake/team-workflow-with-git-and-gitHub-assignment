# Team-workflow-with-Git-and-GitHub: Assignment



## Problem

This exercise is a little bit different.  Rather than following my exact instructions step by step, I'd like for you to come up with your own scenarios that meet my requirements.

Start by creating a new repo.  Make a file or two in the repo for you to work on.

If you need some inspiration...I'll be working in a file called `greetings.txt` It will contain greetings in different languages.

### 1: Fast Forward Merge

**Your goal is to generate a fast forward merge. Demonstrate that you understand how FF merges work by creating one on your own!**

Make a new branch. Do some work in the repo such that when you merge the new branch into master, it results in a fast forward merge.  Merge that branch into master and see if you were right!

```
Write the steps here.

```



### 2: Merge Commit (No Conflicts)

Your goal is to generate a merge commit with NO MERGE CONFLICTS.

Create a new branch. Make some changes to the repo such that when you merge the new branch into master, it results in a merge commit.  The merge should not result in any conflicts. Merge that branch into master and see if you were right!

```
Write the steps here.

```

### 3:  Conflicts!

 Create a new branch. Make some changes to the repo such that when you merge the new branch into master, it results in a merge commit.  The merge should not result in any conflicts. Merge that branch into master and see if you were right!

 ```
  Write the steps here.

 ```
